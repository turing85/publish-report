# Github action to publish reports

This action allows us to publish reports as github-actions check and produce comments on Pull requests with a summary of
the report.

By identifying comments through `comment-header` (which will be transformed to an invisible `html` comment, containing the `comment-header` to identify comments controlled by this action), we can update an existing comment, adding more information as new reports get available over the run of a workflow.


## Components
This action is a composite action, it uses the following actions:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

[`actions/checkout@v3`][checkout]

  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

[`acmarocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2`][checkout]

  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

[`actions/download-artifact@v3`][download]

  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

[`test-reporting@v10`][report]

  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>

[`cancel-action@0.3`][cancel]

  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Quick reference
### Permission setup (for personal repositories)
```yaml
name: My Workflow
...
permissions:
  actions: write       # Necessary to cancel workflow executions
  checks: write        # Necessary to write reports
  pull-requests: write # Necessary to comment on PRs
...
```

### Post initial comment
This snippet will post a comment with the given `comment-header` to the PR that triggered the workflow execution. Any existing comments with the same `comment-header` will be hidden as `OUTDATED`:

```yaml
jobs:
  ...
  jobs:
  recreate-comment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Publish Report
        uses: turing85/publish-report@v1
        with:
          checkout: 'true'
          comment-header: my-comment-header
          comment-message-recreate: Hello
          recreate-comment: true
  ...
```

### Generate test report and append message to existing comment
The report will be generated from the files selected by the glob pattern in `pattern-path`. The name of the report will be `report-name` + `" Report"`.

If all tests succeeded, the message `comment-message-success` will be appended to the comment with the given `comment-header`. If tests failed, the message in `comment-message-failure` will be appended to the comment with the given `comment-header`.

We set the execution of the `Publish Report` step to `if: ${{ always() }}` so that it is also executed when tests fail (and we get a report).

```yaml
jobs:
  ...
  jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      ...
      - name: Run Tests
        ...
      ...
      - name: Publish Report
        uses: turing85/publish-report@v1
        if: ${{ always() }}
        with:
          # cancel-workflow-on-error: 'false' # If we do not want to cancel the whole workflow execution on error
          # checkout: 'true' # not needed; project is already checked out 
          comment-header: my-comment-header
          comment-message-success: |
            YAY! {0} passed!  
            
            {1} tests were successful, {2} tests failed, {3} test were skipped.
            
            The report can be found [here]({4}).

          comment-message-failure: |
            On no! {0} failed!  

            {1} tests were successful, {2} tests failed, {3} test were skipped.

            The report can be found [here]({4}).
          report-name: Tests
          report-path: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST*.xml'
          report-reporter: java-junit
  ...
```

### Generate test report from a downloaded artifact and append message to existing comment
When we have a scenario where we cannot or do not want the report generation the same job as the test, we can upload the test artifacts via [`actions/upload-artifact`][upload]. We can then execute report generation in a separate step, downloading said test artifacts.

Notice that the `name` and `path` used in action `actions/upload-artifact` correlates with `download-artifact-name` and `report-path` in action `turing/publish-report`. 

We should configure the `test` job so that it does not fail when tests fail. This guarantees  that the `test-report` job is executed, and can fail (as long as `report-fail-on-error` is not set to `'false'`).

```yaml
...
jobs:
  ...
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      ...
      - name: Run Tests
        ...
      ...
      - name: Upload test artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        if: ${{ always() }}
        with:
          name: test-report
          path: '**/target/*-reports/TEST*.xml'
          if-no-files-found: error
          retention-days: 2

  test-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    needs:
      ...
      - test
      ...

    steps:
      - name: Publish Report
        uses: turing85/publish-report@v1
        with:
          ...
          checkout: true
          ...
          download-artifact-name: test-report
          report-path: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST*.xml'
          ...
  ...
```
